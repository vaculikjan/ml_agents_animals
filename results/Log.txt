discrete_mask_test1 - added discrete masking on actions, which forbids certain actions from being performed (perfect for this use case)
discrete_mask_test5 - locked action taking while eating, because the animal was changing actions too frequently and never finished eating (would require to consecutively do nothing for 300 steps [3s to eat]- very unlikely)
discrete_mask_test14 - increased energy consumption and doubled positive rewards
discrete_mask_test16 - increased food value 5x and decreased hunger generation 10x
no_energy_test1 - removed energy, changed food positons to localPosition
no_energy_test2 - lowered checkpoint_interval
explicit_food1 - set food to eat explicitly like seek
explicit_food8 - set spawn area to half of the allowed area
explicit_food9 - add random rotation at the beginning of episode
no_food_selection1 - lowered time to eat, food not selected explicitly, IMPORTANT: FIXED REWARD GAINS
no_food_selection5 - uninterruptible seek
no_food_selection9 - first usable brain - "Add first working version" commit
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
no_food_selection11 - reduce food detection radius - seems to be learning fine
no_food_selection12 - return seek interruption (by wander and idle)
no_food_selection13 - redo logic on food detection, add 5f reward for detecting new food - learned, but doesn't use wander 
no_food_selection14 - only update food list when in wander state - learned well
