discrete_mask_test1 - added discrete masking on actions, which forbids certain actions from being performed (perfect for this use case)
discrete_mask_test5 - locked action taking while eating, because the animal was changing actions too frequently and never finished eating (would require to consecutively do nothing for 300 steps [3s to eat]- very unlikely)
discrete_mask_test14 - increased energy consumption and doubled positive rewards
discrete_mask_test16 - increased food value 5x and decreased hunger generation 10x
no_energy_test1 - removed energy, changed food positons to localPosition
no_energy_test2 - lowered checkpoint_interval
explicit_food1 - set food to eat explicitly like seek
explicit_food8 - set spawn area to half of the allowed area
explicit_food9 - add random rotation at the beginning of episode
no_food_selection1 - lowered time to eat, food not selected explicitly, IMPORTANT: FIXED REWARD GAINS
no_food_selection5 - uninterruptible seek
no_food_selection9 - first usable brain - "Add first working version" commit
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
no_food_selection11 - reduce food detection radius - seems to be learning fine
no_food_selection12 - return seek interruption (by wander and idle)
no_food_selection13 - redo logic on food detection, add 5f reward for detecting new food - learned, but doesn't use wander 
no_food_selection14 - only update food list when in wander state - learned well
--- Clean up code commit ---
energy1 - added energy, hunger/s -> 0.005, energy/s -> -0.025, energy regen/s -> 0.1 (idle/eat)
energy2 - added energy as observation ~ 800s - seems to be learning, however deer moves "choppily" - it stands still very often to regen energy -> add sleep state
energy3 - add sleep state ~ 1200s - stuck in local minima - tries to sleep as much as possible, not desirable behavior
energy4 - lower energy gained when sleeping - same as above
energy5 - change reward logic
energy7 - seek can't be interrupted by another seek
--- Add non working versions for saving purposes commit --
no_negative_reward1 - remove periodic negative reward, set -10 when agent dies, still give positive reward when attribute value satiated
no_negative_reward2 - bug fix
no_negative_reward3 - value update (hunger/s -> 0.001, energy/s -> -0.001, energy regen/s -> 0.25, food value = 0.5)
no_negative_reward4 - set stacked vectors to 1
no_negative_reward5 - tune hyperparams -- seems ok
--- ---
aggregate_reward1 - add different reward functiopn
aggregate_reward2 - adjust reward values
aggregate_reward3 - adjust reward values
aggregate_reward4 - working version

--- ---
curiosity1 - add curiosity
curiosity2 - bug fixes
curiosity3 - lessen the impact of curiosity
curiosity4 - bug fix - agent doesn't die, but largely ignores curiosity ->
curiosity5 - increase impact, also add "aging" to end episode with a positive reward (dying of old age)
curiosity6 - bug fixes
curiosity7 - bug fixes
curiosity8 - increase timespan
curiosity9 - double attribute gains
curiosity10 - half attribute gains, increase life span, remove positive reward at life end

WolfTests - testing whether wolf learns to eat the deer (he did)

-- -- 
sim_test1 - give deer the capability to run away and thest their first interactions

3/24/2024 - added chase cooldown
3_24_ppo3 - seems promising
4_01_ppo - hunger condition was - if (hunger > 0.5) return; - needed to invert
4_01_ppo2 - wolf is struggling -> changing flee multiplier modifier from 5 to 3
4_01_ppo3 - wolf is struggling, remove hunger < 0.5f condition
4_01_ppo4 - wolf is struggling, decrease flee accel from 3 to 2, decrease deer accel rate from 1.5 to 1, increase wolf movement speed from 33 to 40, also make eat not interruptible
4_01_ppo5 - wolf slight improvement, increase food detection radius from 100 to 150, also increase safety distance to 155 and pursuit range to 100
4_01_ppo6 - wolf was NOT struggling in last or this one, I just made a mistake, reeverting to ppo4 values and adjusting from there
4_01_ppo7 - wolf still dominant, further reduce detection radius from 150 to 100 and increase flee accel to 3 from 2.5, also reduce pursuit range to 80
4_01_ppo8 - wolf still dominant, increase acceleration rate from 1.5 to 3 and increase movement speed to 33 from 30
4_01_ppo9 - increase deer move speed to 40 from 33, reduce wolf food detection radius to 80 (also adjust safe distance)
4_01_ppo10 - seems promising, try longer training
4_01_ppo10-2 - wolf dominant
4_01_ppo11 - re-enable hunger check
